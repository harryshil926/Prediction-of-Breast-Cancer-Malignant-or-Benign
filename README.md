# Prediction of Breast Cancer: Malignant or Benign

The dataset consists of features that are computed from a digitized image of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass. They describe characteristics of the cell nuclei present in the image. Feature Engineering was performed using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce the model complexity and address the issue of multicollinearity. Classification was performed using Logistic Regression. K-fold cross validation was used to check the adaptability of the model to enw samples. Also a high recall indicates that the misclassification of maligant samples happens rarely. This is essential for bioinformatics classification problems, since a high false negative rate could be fatal.

The dataset has been taken from the UCI Machine Learning Repository:
